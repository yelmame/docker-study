# Docker

Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into a lightweight, portable container. These containers can run consistently across different environments, from a developer’s laptop to production servers.


Why Use Docker?

✅ Portability – Containers run the same on any system with Docker installed (Windows, macOS, Linux, cloud, etc.).

✅ Lightweight – Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient than traditional virtual machines (VMs).

✅ Fast Deployment – Containers start in seconds compared to VMs, improving scalability.

✅ Consistency – Works seamlessly across different environments (development, testing, and production).

✅ Microservices Architecture – Helps break applications into smaller, independent services.
