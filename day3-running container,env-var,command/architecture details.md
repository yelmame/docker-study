What is Docker Daemon?

Docker daemon manages all the services by communicating with other daemons. It manages docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes with the help of the API requests of Docker.

Docker Client

With the help of the docker client, the docker users can interact with the docker. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with multiple daemons. When a docker client runs any docker command on the docker terminal then the terminal sends instructions to the daemon. The Docker daemon gets those instructions from the docker client withinside the shape of the command and REST APIâ€™s request.

The main objective of the docker client is to provide a way to direct the pull of images from the docker registry and run them on the docker host. The common commands which are used by clients are docker build, docker pull, and docker run.

Docker Host
A Docker host is a type of machine that is responsible for running more than one container. It comprises the Docker daemon, Images, Containers, Networks, and Storage.

Docker Registry
All the docker images are stored in the docker registry. There is a public registry which is known as a docker hub that can be used by anyone. We can run our private registry also. With the help of docker run or docker pull commands, we can pull the required images from our configured registry. Images are pushed into configured registry with the help of the docker push command.

Docker Objects
Whenever we are using a docker, we are creating and use images, containers, volumes, networks, and other objects. Now, we are going to discuss docker objects:-
