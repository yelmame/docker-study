# Docker volume 

### Problem with container without volume 

#### 1. Data Loss on Container Deletion
Problem: All data written to the container’s filesystem is ephemeral. If the container is stopped, removed, or crashes, any stored data is lost.

Example: A database container like PostgreSQL without a volume will lose all data after docker rm.

#### 2. No Data Sharing Across Containers
Problem: Without volumes, you can't easily share data between multiple containers.

Example: A web server and an app server needing access to the same static files can't share them easily without a volume.

#### 3. Lack of Persistence Between Deployments
Problem: In production, updates or re-deployments of containers result in fresh containers. Without volumes, configuration files, logs, or uploaded files will be lost.

#### 4. Difficult Development Workflow
Problem: Without a volume mapping from the host, you can’t live-edit code or configuration and see changes reflected in the container immediately.

Example: For Node.js development, you'd need to rebuild the image every time you change a file.

#### 5. Harder Backup and Recovery
Problem: It's much harder to back up data stored inside a container’s layered filesystem than using a mounted volume directory.

#### 6. Container Bloat
Problem: Writing data inside containers increases their size over time, which can make them harder to manage and slower to export/import.

#### 7. Security and Permissions Issues
Problem: Without using named volumes or proper host volume mounts, you may run into issues where the container has incorrect permissions for writing data.





### solution to above problem 

#### 1 Bind mount 
it binds folder on container to folder to host 

#### 2 volume 
- it has lifecycle i.e create delete 
- it can create an host , external sources(aws,s3)
- volume offers backup and you can move it from aws to host 
- you can manage it with docker cli (commands)

##### how to use volume in container
both are same but only syntax difference 
docker -v attaching volume 
docker --mount 


commands :

1. list volume 

``` bash
 docker volume ls
 docker volume inspect name_of_volume
 dockere vomune rm volume_name 
 
`
